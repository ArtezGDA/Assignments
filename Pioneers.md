###Assignment #1:
#Pioneers

##Learning Goals

Learn the basic skills of programming in python. Develop a method of documenting your coding efforts and sketches. Gain insights in the history of human-computer interaction and the people and ideas involved in this research. Develop a vision on structuring and organizing information in the digital age. Being able to produce sketches and a prototype for an information system and structure.

##Description

This assignment consists out of two parts: a **coding** part and a **systems design** part.

#### Coding

The coding part will be covering basic concepts of programming in *python*. Hopefully this is partly a refreshing-your-memory kind of course, as we will be touching the basic coding concepts that you're probably still familar with from processing: `for`-loops, `if`-statements, `variables`. The language of coding will be different: *python* instead of *java* (Processing), but conceptually that change isn't dramatic, and might even help understanding these concepts better.

Each week there will be some explanation and examples of these coding concept. And each week there will be some coding homework allowing you to apply the concepts yourself and experiment with the code.
 
We will discuss the following coding constructs:

- `for` loops
- variables
- `if` statements
- GitHub
- Types: `int` / `bool` / `float` / `string`
- Arrays,

and one collaboration tool:

- GitHub.com

#### Systems Design

![Sketchpad](images/sketchpad_sutherland.jpg)

Design (the system and structure for) a **catalogue** of the inventions of *Human-Computer Interaction* pioneers.

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study of the interaction the interface and the interface between us, humans, and computers that allows us to give instructions to the computer and allows the computer to gives us feedback about the process and the outcome. It deals with both **hardware inventions** (e.g. the mouse or novel 3D pen), **software inventions** (e.g. the trick that allows you to switch between applications, or copy and paste) and **visual and metaphores inventions** (e.g. the idea of windows, the idea of folders that store information.)

From the early 1960s onward, computers became powerful enough to require and allow for systems to aid the human in using them. Most of the computer concepts and peripherals that we are still using today were invented in this era, 1960s and early 1970s; the computer mouse, draggable windows, folders, etcera. This assignment is party a **study of the pioneers of that era**, who brought us these inventions.

The design assigment itself is **to design** the structure and system of **a catalogue** to collect and record the work of these pioneers.

Because much of the work of these pioneers also tries to solve the problems of smarter information storage and retrieval, your catalogue should try to do the same: find a novel way to collect and organize the information about these pioneers, their work, ideas and inventions. So that knowlegde is augmented, insights can be gained, and historic ideas can be combined into new ones. Hence, the design of this catalogue *should focus on the structure of the information and the systems to store and retrieve it*, rather than only on the visual appearance of this catalogue.

Your design should consist of **sketches**, **diagrams** and **models** of these structures and systems; **a prototype** of the complete catalogue (demonstrating its use case); and a few **detailed cards** / pages / entries, as an example of the visual result.

The following human-computer interaction pioneers will be studied:

-  Vannevar Bush
- Ivan Sutherland
- Douglas Engelbart
- Alan Kay
- Theodore Nelson
- Bret Victor
