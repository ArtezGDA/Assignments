## Setup

#### Install Z-shell and the dotfiles

Get the dotfiles from [zsh-dotfiles](https://github.com/irlabs/zsh-dotfiles) on github and follow its install guide.

- set **zsh** as your default shell
- install the dotfiles
- enable the alt key as meta key

####General Note:
#####Avoid spaces in names of files or directories

It is good practice to avoid spaces ` ` in names of files or directories. Spaces can be used in the command line by *escaping* them with a `\ `: e.g. `cd Classes/Media\ Design/Homework`. But this is easy to forget and then cause errors. Because real spaces have different behavior: e.g. `touch Media Design` creates **two** files: one called *Media*, the other called *Design*.

Also spaces in url or file names on websites are likely to break. (Again, spaces can be *escaped* by using `%20`, but this is far from convenient)

Instead of spaces, use underscores (`_`), dashes (`-`), or **C**amel**C**asing.
