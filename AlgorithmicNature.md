###Assignment #1:
#Algorithmic Nature

##Learning Goals

Develop an understanding of algorithms and how to use them to create procedural drawings. Acquire an insight in the process of producing visuals through computer code. Being able to produce visually interesting works using procedural drawings. Collect a set of techniques that you will able to use in future works.

##Description

Study the following 5 algorithms and create computer generated sketches and drawings using them. From each of these algorithms an example in code will be given. The assignment is to take this example and experiment with it further, creating unique and interesting drawings / sketches.

####These are the five algorithms

- fibonacci
- perlin noise
- recursion
- L-systems
- flocking

*(ordered from simple to advanced)*

####Limitations

To make the assignment a little more interesting and concrete, these are the limitation the drawings or sketches should adhere to:

- the canvas of the drawings are square (dimension should not matter if you use vectors)
- only use black and white and greyscales
- take a model from nature as inspiration
- the drawings must be procedural, meaning a computer renders them based on your rules
- you must code the drawings your self
- use python as programing language
- publish source code and results on gitHub

##Planning
