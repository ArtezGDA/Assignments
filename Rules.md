#Rules

#### On Being on time and Presence

We cover a lot of ground during the lessons. There will be many in-class tutorials and hands-on exercises. Therefor your presence is vital to your success in this class.

Class starts at `09:15` in the morning and `13:15` in the afternoon. There is an *extra 15 minutes courtesy in the morning* in case of delayed public transport or other unforseen circumstances. In the afternoon there are no such circumstances, so this courtesy is limited to *just 5 minutes*.

If you enter the class after this, *you will be marked as absent* and not be allowed to join the class until after the tea break.

Engagement and working along with the code examples and tutorials is even more important than your physical presence. Therefor, if you spend the lesson doing other stuff, irrelevant to this course, then you could as well be absent. *So you will be marked as absent.*

Per semester you are allowed to be absent a *maximum of three times*. This only counts if you provide a valid reason for your absence, before the class starts, if possible.

If you exceed this maximum, or cannot provide a valid reason for your absence, you will receive an insufficient mark for this class.

#### On Homework

The only way you can learn how to code is to practice and experiment. Practice, practice, practice! Only through practice and experimentation, you'll learn the pitfalls, how to solve them, and begin to understand the building blocks you have available for your coding.

Therefor it is vital that you spend at least 3 hours a week on homework doing coding. You will be checked for this.

#### Copyrights

All of the works and code you produce in this class, are required to be made **Open Source**, under an **MIT license**.  
(In general, all of the works you produce as a student at ArtEZ are copyrighted by ArtEZ.)

#### Code Sharing

All the code needs to be shared publicly on GitHub, so that everyone can benefit from it, learn from it, can fork from it and contribute to it.

#### Attribution (bronvermelding)

You are allowed to borrow ideas and techniques from others, although it would be polite you mention your inspiration in your footnotes.

If you want to quote another author (and you are encouraged to do so, if it is relevant to your case!), you must attribute the quote and the author, preferably including the source from which you took the quote.

If you want to use computer code from a third source, you need to first check the license under which the code was produced. If this license permits re-use or alteration, you are allowed you use the code under the rules as described in the license.

In any case, in the context of this class, your are required to mention your sources of inspiration if you are just borrowing techniques; and if you use code verbatim, you are required to attribute the code to the original authors, preferably linking to the source.

#### Planning

Making and delivering great projects require strict planning. You'll have to learn how to best plan your projects, taking into account external conditions, a digital workflow and your personality.

We will take extra care of planning during the course, but the best way of accomplishing great results is through iterations. That means that you repeat your process a few times, until everything is right, instead of trying to do it all right at once the first time.

Such iterations often compass the following steps:

- analysis
- idea
- sketch
- prototype
- test
