###Assignment #3:
#Tool

## Introduction

As a designer you should not only develop the skills and have the obligation to produce your own work, you should also develop the skills and have the obligation to build or repair your **own tools**. Just as a carpenter should know how to sharpen his saw, or build his own workbench, a designer should know how to repair the short comings of Illustrator, or build a very own font-generator.

You should realize that when application designer and developer who works at e.g. Adobe, designs the workflow of, say, Indesign, they do have specific users in mind, with a specific use case, who need to complete a specific workflow. They will try to find the most common demoninator, the use case that will benefit the most users. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the application is optimized for *your* workflow. 

Therefor this assignment is all about not taking for granted these apps, operating systems, and plugins thrown at you by the Apple's and Adobe's of this world, but creating your own tools.

##Description


##### Color Picker

**Design a new type of color picker**

The first part of this assignment is making a color picker: a tool to select, pick or save a color. Analyse in which digital workflow the current color picking tools are insufficient. Describe the situation, the short comings of the current tools, and how a new tool could solve that.

Sketch a concept. Then design and present a prototype.

##### Your Own Tool

**Create a tool that streamline your workflow**

For your own tool you take this analysis one step further: analyse bottlenecks and imprecision in your current workflows (for any of your courses).  
Design a tool that could streamline or perfect that workflow. Describe the concept and make sketches of the new flow and of details in the interface.  
Produce a prototype of the tool that you can demo.  
Create a proof of concept using code, to demonstrate the main premise of the tool.
