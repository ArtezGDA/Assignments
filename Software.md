#Software

This software needs to be installed on your own computer (provided you have a Mac that can run all this). Some of the following are applications that can simply be installed by dragging them to the *Applications* folder. Others are command line tools and plugins that require a bit more work.

##Apps

###GitHub app

An easy and accessible app to have you work with `git` (and especially GitHub)

- info: https://desktop.github.com
- download: https://central.github.com/mac/latest

### Gapplin

A simple, free **SVG** viewer. Nothing fancy, except just about 100x faster than Illustrator if you want to preview an svg file. And it updates live, so you see the svg file change as you work on it.

- info: http://gapplin.wolfrosch.com
- download: via de Mac App Store (http://appstore.com/mac/Gapplin)

### Plotdevice

An open source Mac app and graphics language for drawing through *python* code.

- info: http://plotdevice.io
- dowload: http://plotdevice.io/app/PlotDevice_app-0.10.0.zip

and finally:

### Mou

A very convenient editor for markdown (`.md`) files, which lets you see both the code and the result in one view.

Possibly Mou will be a paid app soon, as they just announced their 1.0 version.

Currently you can download the free beta version, but I don't know if that will stay available and what will happen with it.

Their preorder price is $15, which is Ok considering the usefulness.
