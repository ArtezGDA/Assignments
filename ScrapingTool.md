###Assignment #3:
# Scraping Tool

##### [Group Work Repository](https://github.com/ArtezGDA/Tool-Assignment)

## Introduction

As a designer you should not only develop the skills and have the obligation to produce your own work, you should also develop the skills and have the obligation to build or repair your **own tools**. Just as a carpenter should know how to sharpen his saw, or build his own workbench, a designer should know how to repair the short comings of Illustrator, or build his/her very own font-generator.

You should realize that when an application designer or developer who works at e.g. Adobe, designs the workflow of, say, Indesign, they do have specific users in mind, with a specific use case, and a specific workflow to complete. The team will try to find the most common denominator, the use case that will benefit the most users. But that obviously doesn't always mean that their application is optimized for *your* workflow. 

This assignment is all about not taking for granted these apps, operating systems, and plugins thrown at you by the Apple's and Adobe's of this world, but creating your own tools.

##Description

- Sketch a concept. Then design and present a prototype.

##### Your Own Tool

**Create a tool that streamline your workflow**

For your own tool you take this analysis one step further: analyse bottlenecks and imprecision in your current workflows (for any of your courses).  
Design a tool that could streamline or perfect that workflow. Describe the concept and make sketches of the new flow and of details in the interface.  
Produce a prototype of the tool that you can demo.  
Create a proof of concept using code, to demonstrate the main premise of the tool.

----
##Learning Goals

Establish a critical position towards the status quo of available digital tools, applications, operating systems and devices. Verbalize the shortcomings, failures, lacks and mismatches of their designed workflow. Develop the skills and insights to create and present a clear, well informed and convincing demo of a non-existing tool. Acquire the technical understanding and skills to code the essence of a workflow-enhancing tool.

- Evaluation


- Collect ideas and concepts for real tool, your own tool
- Scrape a web page with [Xpath and Google spreadsheets](Lesson_07_Scraping_with_Xpath.md)
- Write and sketch the concept for your own tool
- Watch Bret Victor's *Inventing on Principle*
- Regular Expressions: [Regex Tools and Tutorials](Lesson_08_Regex.md)
- Class talks: Present concept for your own tool
- Prepare a demo for your own tool
- Finalize Proof of Concept and Demo
- [Write proper documentation for your tool!](HowToWriteGoodDocumentation.md)


##Evaluation

Your *critcal analysis*, *concepts*, *demos* and *proof of concept* will be judged according to their **qualities**, the displayed **insights**, the general **applicability** and **usefulness** of the tool and your means to explain, **demonstrate** and examplify its functions and applications.

The final grade for this assignment is constructed from these parts:

- analysis of current status quo & concept for tool
- demo of tool
- proof of concept
- proper documentation about your tool on github
