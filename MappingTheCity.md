###Assignment #4:
#Mapping the City

##### [Shared Data Repository: MappingTheCity-Data](https://github.com/ArtezGDA/MappingTheCity-Data)
##### [Design Work Repository: MappingTheCity-Maps](https://github.com/ArtezGDA/MappingTheCity-Maps)

## Introduction

For decades there is a global shift going of people moving from rural to urban areas. The same can be said of (digital) information. Cities are a concentration of vast quantaties of ever increasing data. This assigment is about getting a grasp on these vast amounts of data, and being able to use this data to perform research and to tell meaningfull stories and demonstrate analytical insights.

#### Iterations

For every complex project, whether that is an interactive or static work, the final quality will greatly benefit from doing small iterations instead of attempting to do all in one final stretch. Especially in a project where data is researched, scraped and visualized, iterations will present the opportunity to reflect on the work and to refine, enrich and amend the data and the end result.

That is why for this assignment we will do **three** iterations of a poster.

#### Two-part assignment

The assignment is a two part assignment:

- Collaborative Group assigment:
	- Group of maximum 3 people (team up coders with non-coders)
	- Collection and Grooming of the data
	- Store in [Shared Data Repository](https://github.com/ArtezGDA/MappingTheCity-Data)
- Individual assignment:
	- Constructing your own story and designing the poster
	- Store in [Design Work Repository](https://github.com/ArtezGDA/MappingTheCity-Maps)

#### Getting the data

- Do research. Find data sources. 
- From the data develop your own opinion, stance and vision on cities, agglomerations and urbanization.
- To illustrate your point, select one or more rich data sources with either:
	 - points in time
	 - geographical locations
	 - network of connections
- Groom the data into one or more `.json` files, ready to be used:
	- Parse this data,
	- Filter it,
	- Mine it,
	- Scrape additional data,
	- Combine it and
	- Refine it,
- All of this, while documenting your process and results open source on github.

#### Telling the story

- Design a poster that plots out the data as representational map of your story.
- Iterate the poster three times.

----
## Learning Goals

Acquire a fluency into working with big data research and creating information graphics. Articulate a vision or insight about cities and urbanization. Familiarize yourself with the process of creating a meaningful and readable map from structured data. Being able to independently create a concept, draft and multiple iterations of a research based map or poster.

----
## Planning

The complete planning of the next 11 weeks is not final yet, but we will go over these topics:

- Data formats for storing research data: csv, xml, **json**, database
- Python: database (sqlite) & SQL
- Javascript: TileMill / MapBox / Modest Maps
- Javascript: Illustrator Scripting
- Extra tools as inspiration:
	- Graphiz & dot
	- D3.js

**Homework:**

- Scrape the data from the sources.
- Create and groom one or more `.json` files.
- Document the purpose, contents, structure, and attributes of your `.json` files.
- Make open source:
	- the source data (or link to live data)
	- your analysis of the data
	- your methods and tools to scrape and groom the data
	- the structured .json files

- Evaluation

##Evaluation

Criteria for judging the work:
Process, Structure, Insight, Coding Skills, Persuasiveness and Relevance, Truthfulness, Open Source, Quantity of the Data (see below) and Communicating Quality of the Design and Presentation.

Finally, to make sure the poster is coded (and not drawn by hand), there is a formal criteria on the *quantity* of data. The data source and the poster should contain at least:

- over > 100 relations / links / connections,
- over > 250 locations on a map,
- over > 500 points in time,

**or** a combination of those.
