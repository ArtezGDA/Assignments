## Introduction


##Description

1. - Watch 3 movies:
1.1. Revolution OS (available on youtube)
1.2. Everything is a Remix (4 part series) (website) 1.3. R.I.P. a Remix Manifesto
2. - From these movies develop your own opinion, stance and vision on remixing, open source, copyrights and/or patents.
3. - With this vision and these movies as inspiration, find a rich data source with [points in time | geographical locations | network of connections] to illustrate your point.
4. Parse this data, filter it, mine it, scrape additional data, combine it and refine it, while documenting your process as open source on github.
5. Design a poster that plots out the data as representational map of your story.
6. Iterate the poster three times.

##Learning Goals

Acquire an insight into big data research and creating information graphics. Develop a vision about open source and copyright.
Make the process of creating a meaningful and readable map from structured data your own. Being able to independently create a concept, draft and multiple iterations of a research based map.

##Evaluation

Group Presentation & Plenary discussion
Criteria for judging the work:
Process, Structure, Insight, Coding Skills, Persuasiveness and relevance, Truthfulness, Open Source, Quantity of the Data (see below) and Communicating Quality of the Design and Presentation.
Finally, to make sure the poster is coded (and not drawn by hand), there is a formal criteria on the quantity of data:
The data source (and consequently the poster) should contain at least
>100 relations / links / connections,
> 250 locations on a map,
> 500 points in time,
or a combination of two or three of the above
