###Assignment #4:
#Mapping the City

##### [Shared Data Repository: MappingTheCity-Data](https://github.com/ArtezGDA/MappingTheCity-Data)
##### [Design Work Repository: MappingTheCity-Maps](https://github.com/ArtezGDA/MappingTheCity-Maps)

## Introduction

For decades there is a global shift going of people moving from rural to urban areas. The same can be said of (digital) information. Cities are a concentration of vast quantaties of ever increasing data. This assigment is about getting a grasp on these vast amounts of data, and being able to use this data to perform research and to tell meaningfull stories and demonstrate analytical insights.

##Description

- Do research. Find data sources. 
- From the data develop your own opinion, stance and vision on cities, agglomerations and urbanization.
- Select a rich data source with [points in time | geographical locations | network of connections] to illustrate your point.
- Parse this data, filter it, mine it, scrape additional data, combine it and refine it, while documenting your process as open source on github.
- Design a poster that plots out the data as representational map of your story.
- Iterate the poster three times.

The assignment is a two part assignment:

- Collaborative Group assigment:
	- Group of maximum 3 people (team up coders with non-coders)
	- Collection and Grooming of the data
	- Store in [Shared Data Repository](https://github.com/ArtezGDA/MappingTheCity-Data)
- Individual assignment:
	- Constructing your own story and designing the poster
	- Store in [Design Work Repository](https://github.com/ArtezGDA/MappingTheCity-Maps)

##Learning Goals

Acquire a fluency into working with big data research and creating information graphics. Articulate a vision or insight about cities and urbanization. Familiarize yourself with the process of creating a meaningful and readable map from structured data. Being able to independently create a concept, draft and multiple iterations of a research based map or poster.

- Evaluation

##Evaluation

Group Presentation & Plenary discussion
Criteria for judging the work:
Process, Structure, Insight, Coding Skills, Persuasiveness and relevance, Truthfulness, Open Source, Quantity of the Data (see below) and Communicating Quality of the Design and Presentation.
Finally, to make sure the poster is coded (and not drawn by hand), there is a formal criteria on the quantity of data:
The data source (and consequently the poster) should contain at least
>100 relations / links / connections,
> 250 locations on a map,
> 500 points in time,
or a combination of two or three of the above
