# Graph Examples

### Demonstrating how to create some graphs from the JSON data

## Visualizing the "Long Tail"

Our data has 12599 cities with population figures. The assumption is that the population will be distributed in a long tail: a few cities have extremely high numbers of populations, while the majority of cities will have very small number of populations.

Because we have so much data (12599 cities), we need to think of a strategy to map these into a single graph.

First do some more analysis on the data.
