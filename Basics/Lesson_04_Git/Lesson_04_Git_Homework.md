# Homework working with git and GitHub

### Use a shared repository

- Clone our shared repository ("Pioneers")
- Modify the repository to add your contributions:
    - Create your own personal folder inside the _Students_ folder
    - Create a `README.md` file inside that folder
    - Create a link to that file in the `Students.md` file
- Commit your changes
- Sync (pull & push) your changes to the GitHub repository

### Your own repository

- Create your own repository
- Sync the repository to GitHub, or clone it locally (depending on how you created it)
- Add the default files:
    - a `.gitignore` file for your programmig language of choice (Python)
    - a license: the **MIT License**
    - a `README.md` file
- perform the initial commit
- Modity the readme
- Make a second commit
- Sync the repository with GitHub

### Clone an existing repository and suggest an improvement

- Look at the "FaultySpelling" repository
- Make a fork of that repository
- Clone that fork locally
- Make a branch different than `master`
- Fix the spelling errors in the README.md
- commit those edits to your branch
- sync (push) the branch to GitHub
- Create a **pull request** to the original repository, suggesting this edit.
