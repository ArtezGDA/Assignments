# Coding homework about `for` loops

- create the following sequences

#### sequence 1
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

#### sequence 2
```
1
4
9
16
25
```

#### sequence 3
```
10
9
8
7
6

liftoff!
```

### Create a grid

- grid of 25 by 25 crosses, with 15 pixels in between.
- experiment with the grid and create images, similar to these:

![grid experiment 1](grid_experiment1.png)  
![grid experiment 2](grid_experiment2.png)  
![grid experiment 3](grid_experiment3.png)  
![grid experiment 4](grid_experiment4.png)  

### Clock animation

- create a clock animation

See the animation example for a template how to create an animation in plotdevice

### Three tricks:

- if trying, try with subset of range (e.g. `range(5, 25)`, instead `range(100)` )
- set `fontsize()` and `fill()` color, each time after the `clear(all)`
- with text formatting, use `%02` to create the string *"03"* from the number *3*. 

### For extra points: 

- create a animation of a analog clock, like this one:
