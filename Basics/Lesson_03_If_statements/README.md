# `If` Statements

## Basic structure of an `if` statement

```python
if condition:
    # do something only if the condition is true
    pass
```

### Simple `if`

```python
x = 5
if x == 6:
    print "only when x equals five"
```

### `if` and `else`

```python
x = 5
if x == 6:
    print "only when x equals five"
else:
    print "x is something else than 5"
```

### `if`, `elif`, `elif`, ... `else`

```python
# Change this assignment of the variable x to different values to experiment with the if statements.
x = 5

#
if x == 4:
    print "only when x equals four"
elif x == 5:
    print "Five!"
elif x == 6:
    print "It is six"
else:
    print "x is something else than 4, 5 or 6"
```


## Boolean Logic

Boolean Logic: the mathematical calculations of logic with only true or false as outcome.

`True`

`False`

`==` equals

`!=` not equals

`<` lesser than

`>`greater than

`<=` lesser than or equal

`>=` greater than or equal

`or`

`and`



#### Examples

`True or False   -> True`

`True and False  -> True`

`not True        -> False`


### If statements inside for loops and vice versa

### When to use `if` statements

Examples of if statements:

- draw a linear grid with lines (or circles / ovals),
    - if statement to toggle the whole thing
    - if statement to toggle each line
- if statement to color the stripes in 3 or 4 colors
- other examples: if statement to sort a deck of cards by suit. (spade with spades, heart with hearts, etc)
