# Coding homework for the `while` loop and *variables*

#### Create this sequence using a `while` loop

```
1
4
9
16
25
```

#### Create a while loop that runs continually forever

Print out something different each time, so you see it is still running.
Stop the process with ctrl + C

For example, print out the sequence of a traffic light:

```
green
orange
red
green
orange
red
green
orange
red
green
...
```

#### Create a continous animation in Plotdevice

Use the `setup()` and `draw()` functions and `global`

For example, make a few elements rotate with different speeds (like an analog clock)
