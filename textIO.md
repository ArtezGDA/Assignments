###Assignment #2:
#Text IO

##Learning Goals

Develop an understanding of how text is represented and stored in a computer. And acquire the skills of how to manipulate those texts in an automated fashion.  
Familiarize yourself with operating the computer using a text-based interface, a.k.a. the **CLI** (*command line interface*), a.k.a. **the Terminal**.  
Gain insight in the limitations, process and effects of remediation. And develop the skills of automating the generation of PDF documents from large text files.

##Description

####Text Input/Output

Collect texts from the collective gitHub repository and remediate this into two forms: an interactive text format and an generated PDF booklet.

###### Input:

Collect text from the collective repository of the previous assignment on gitHub. Select one or more of the following sources:

- comments in code (`#`)
- docstrings (`"""..."""`)
- commit messages 
- *README.md* files

###### Output:

Code a system that is able to output parts of the text, based on dynamic properties or a different form of text input. (This makes it interactive). Choose one of the following forms:

- man page
- twitterbot
- push notifications (received on an Apple Watch) 
- text adventure
- ... (other terminal based text input -> output program)

###### Static output:

Additional to the interactive form the text should be remediated into, create a booklet in paper, printed from a PDF document, which is automatically generated from a text file, using PlotDevice.
