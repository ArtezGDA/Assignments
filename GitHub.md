# GitHub

The code that you produce in this course is required to be **Open Source** and should be available on GitHub. To make it available on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. create an account on GitHub
	- create a (twitterlike) "*handle*", which represents you.
	- fill in your full name, when that's asked, so we can identify you.
	- link to your website if you have one
	- upload a representative avatar image
	
2. collect a list of all your github handles and have the _klassenvertegenwoordiger_ mail that to me. So I can invite you to the ArtezGDA organization.

3. make sure you can login with GitHub, and create a repository to test this.

4. download the GitHub Desktop app
