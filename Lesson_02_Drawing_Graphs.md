# Drawing Graphs

## Techniques

### Matplotlib

Code with [matplotlib](ScrapingLecture/GraphExamples/Word_Frequencies/README.md#method-1-matplotlib)

### Plotdevice

Code in [plotdevice](ScrapingLecture/GraphExamples/Word_Frequencies/README.md#method-2-plotdevice)

### `import plotdevice as pd`

See [`longtail.py`](ScrapingLecture/GraphExamples/longtail.py) as an example

## Examples

- [Visualizing the long tail of cities with populations](ScrapingLecture/GraphExamples/README.md)
- [Draw points on a "map"](ScrapingLecture/GraphExamples/worldmap.pv)
- [Drawing roads in the Netherlands from a "shapefile"](ScrapingLecture/GraphExamples/Roads_in_Netherlands/README.md)
	- Get other shapefile from e.g. [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/features/)
